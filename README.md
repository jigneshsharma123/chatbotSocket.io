# Chatbot Application Documentation

## Purpose
This is a fully web-based chatbot system that interacts with users by asking questions and providing suitable answers based on their queries.

## Key Features
- **Chat History**: The application allows you to save chat history for future reference.
- **OpenAI Integration**: It utilizes the OpenAI API for advanced language processing.

## Architecture
The chatbot application follows a client-server architecture, which enhances real-time communication and minimizes server load.

### Client
Users access the chatbot through their web browsers, allowing them to send messages and interact with the chatbot.

### Server
The server is implemented using the Express.js framework, which facilitates server scripting. It also handles the WebSocket protocol, enabling full-duplex communication with clients.

#### WebSocket
The WebSocket protocol is utilized to maintain continuous and persistent connections with clients. Unlike the traditional polling system, where clients repeatedly request updates, WebSocket ensures that the server can push updates to clients as soon as they become available. This eliminates the need for clients to frequently ask the server if there are new queries or responses, reducing server load and improving real-time communication efficiency.

## Access
To access the chatbot, users simply need to click on the provided link and open it in a web browser.

## Prerequisites
- An electronic device with an internet connection is required to use the chatbot.
